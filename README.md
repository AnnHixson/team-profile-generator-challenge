# team-profile-generator-challenge

## Description

This challenge was designed to take our knowledge of Object Oriented Programming to build an application that can take the information given by a user and generate a webpage for their team.

## Installation

This project uses Node.js v.16.18.0 and inquirer v.8.2.4

## Usage

First, the user should install the package.json (`npm i`) from the command line. Then, upon running the program (`node index.js`), they will be presented with a series of questions about the team members that they are adding. The questions begin with the team manager. Then there is a menu to add an engineer or an intern, or finish making the team. Picking either engineer or intern will result in questions about that team member, followed by a return to the menu. When the user selects "Finish building my team", then the index.html page will be generated and the webpage can be opened. On the webpage, the email's provided are mailto links, and the GitHub profiles provided link to the GitHub profile pages.

Here is a video walkthrough of this application: [https://watch.screencastify.com/v/ajtKPcrCWIcv5wcuofQZ](https://watch.screencastify.com/v/ajtKPcrCWIcv5wcuofQZ)
