# team-profile-generator-challenge

## NOTICE
This challenge is a work in progress. The tests are passed. The commented out section of the index, while in writing would properly run the program, currently breaks the terminal when run. The section after the commented out section, demonstrates the functionality of the classes. The HTML generating portion needs significant styling, a loop, and an 'fs.writeFile'.
